Understanding the Binary Search Tree Code
Overview
The provided C++ code implements a Binary Search Tree (BST) data structure with essential operations: search, insert, delete, and three traversal methods (inorder, preorder, postorder).

Key Components
Node Structure
Represents a single node in the BST.
Contains data to store the value and left and right pointers to child nodes.
Search Function
Recursively traverses the tree to find a node with the given key.
Compares the key with the current node's data and decides to search left or right subtree accordingly.
Insert Function
Recursively inserts a new node into the tree.
Maintains the BST property by placing smaller values to the left and larger values to the right.
Delete Function
Handles three cases:
Node with no child: Directly delete the node.
Node with one child: Replace the node with its child.
Node with two children: Find the in-order successor (minimum value in the right subtree), replace the node's data with it, and recursively delete the in-order successor.
Tree Traversals
Inorder: Visits left subtree, root, then right subtree.
Preorder: Visits root, left subtree, then right subtree.
Postorder: Visits left subtree, right subtree, then root.
